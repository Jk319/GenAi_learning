# Generative AI Learning Repository

Welcome!  
This repository documents my **hands-on learning journey in Generative AI**, 
where I explore concepts, write code, and build small applications while learning step by step.

---

##  Overview

This repository serves as my **personal workspace and learning log** for Generative AI.  
Here, I experiment with modern AI tools and frameworks while understanding both **the concepts and their real-world usage**.

Topics I actively work on include:
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Prompt design and optimization
- LangChain workflows
- Embeddings and vector search
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- API-based GenAI applications

The goal is to move beyond theory and gain **practical, implementation-level understanding**.

---

##  Purpose of This Repository

- Track my daily progress in Generative AI
- Practice writing clean and reusable code
- Build small but meaningful GenAI projects
- Develop skills aligned with industry use cases

---

##  Repository Contents

-  Daily learning and practice scripts  
-  Experimental notebooks and mini projects  
-  Streamlit-based interfaces  
-  Secure API key handling using `.env` files  
-  Integrations with popular GenAI platforms:
  - Google Gemini  
  - OpenAI  
  - Hugging Face  

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Python** (3.9 / 3.10)
- **LangChain**
- **Streamlit**
- **Hugging Face Transformers**
- **Google Generative AI (Gemini)**
- **python-dotenv** for environment variables

---

##  How I Learn

- Study one concept at a time  
- Implement it with code  
- Experiment and improve  
- Push regular updates to GitHub  

This approach helps me stay **consistent and practice-oriented**.

##  Ongoing Work

This repository is actively maintained and will continue to grow as I explore advanced Generative AI topics and build larger projects.

⭐ Feel free to explore and follow my progress!.
